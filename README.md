- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Bowtie7114, but I prefer Bowtie. Maybe even my real name! But we'll save that for later.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in primarily video games. Coding is a passion I've wanted to get into for a long time, and I'm finally taking the plunge.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full Stack Development with the Learning People. Covering HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. I'm looking to get into Lua for my own gain soon.
